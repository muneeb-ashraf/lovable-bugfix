# ️ Bug Fixes Documentation – Lead Capture (v1.0.1)

## Overview
This document outlines the major bugs that were discovered and resolved in the Lead Capture Application.
---
## Critical Fixes Implemented
### 1. Duplicate Confirmation Emails and No Database persistence
**File**: `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Fixed
#### Problem
The lead capture form was sending two confirmation emails for every submission and was not saving the lead's data to the database. This resulted in:
- Annoying users with duplicate emails.
- Loss of valuable lead data.
- Inability to follow up with potential customers.
#### Root Cause
A copy-paste error in the form submission handler caused the `send-confirmation` function to be called twice. The code block that was intended to save the data to the database was instead calling the email function.
#### Fix
The duplicate function call was removed and replaced with the correct Supabase query to insert the lead into the `leads` table.
```typescript
// Before
try {
  const { error: emailError } = await supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation', { ... });
} ...

// After
try {
  const { error: dbError } = await supabase.from('leads').insert([ ... ]);
} ...
```
#### Impact
- ✅ Lead data is now correctly saved to the database.
- ✅ Users receive only one confirmation email.
- ✅ Improved data integrity and user experience.
---
### 2. AI-Powered Email Personalization Failed
**File**: `supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### Problem
The confirmation emails were not being personalized using the OpenAI API as intended. Instead, a generic fallback message was being sent to all users.
#### Root Cause
The code was attempting to access the AI-generated content from the wrong index in the OpenAI API response array. It was using `choices[1]` instead of `choices[0]`.
#### Fix
The code was updated to access the correct index (`[0]`) in the `choices` array of the OpenAI API response.
```typescript
// Before
return data?.choices[1]?.message?.content;

// After
return data?.choices[0]?.message?.content;
```
#### Impact
- ✅ Confirmation emails are now personalized for each user based on their industry.
- ✅ Increased user engagement and a more welcoming experience.
